            <h3 class="banner-title-subtitle">Ada Lovelace (1815 – 1852)</h3>
            <p class="text-left-justify">Ada Lovelace, born in 1815 in the UK, was a pioneering mathematician and writer who is credited with creating the first computer program. The only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron, she is best known for her work on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, an early mechanical computer, considered the first published algorithm intended for implementation on a computer. Her mother, Lady Byron, was determined to provide Ada with a strong education in mathematics and science, which was unusual for a woman in the early 19th century. Going past this cultural obstacles, as you will see, is a common trait of all these women in tech. Her contributions to computer science were not fully recognized until the 1950s, but her insights and ideas paved the way for modern computing and helped shape the digital world as we know it today. She was a visionary thinker who predicted the potential of computers to go beyond mere calculation. She wrote, "The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatsoever to originate anything". Every year, since 2009, the second Tuesday of October is celebrated as International Ada Lovelace Day, a date intended to commemorate the achievements of women in fields such as technology, science, engineering and mathematics.

          <h3 class="banner-title-subtitle">Grace Hopper (1906 – 1992)</h3>
          <p class="text-left-justify">Grace Brewster Murray Hopper was a computer pioneer and naval officer. She received her master’s degree (1930) and a Ph.D. (1934) in mathematics from Yale University. Hopper began her computer science career when all programs were written in numerical code, and she realized that programming would be more accessible if people could code in their own language. This realization led to her invention of the first complier in 1952, a tool that essentially taught computers to “talk.” She later co-invented the COBOL, the first universal programming language used in business and government. Hopper was not only a mathematician and computer scientist, but she was also a gifted teacher and communicator. She took particular pride in teaching: “The most important thing I’ve accomplished, other than building the compiler, is training young people,” she said. “I keep track of them as they get older and I stir ’em up at intervals so they don’t forget to take chances.”

        <h3 class="banner-title-subtitle">Hedy Lamarr (1914 – 2000)</h3>
        <p class="text-left-justify">Hedy Lamarr was an Austrian-American actress and inventor who pioneered the technology that would one day form the basis for today’s WiFi, GPS, and Bluetooth communication systems. Lamarr had an inventive genius as the gears in her inventive mind continued to turn. In 1940 Lamarr met George Antheil at a dinner party. Antheil was another quirky yet clever force to be reckoned with. The two came up with an extraordinary new communication system used with the intention of guiding torpedoes to their targets in war. After its creation, Lamarr and Antheil sought a patent and military support for the invention. While awarded U.S. Patent No. 2,292,387 in August of 1942, the Navy decided against the implementation of the new system. Lamarr also became the first woman to receive the Invention Convention’s Bulbie Gnass Spirit of Achievement Award. Although she died in 2000, Lamarr was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for the development of her frequency hopping technology in 2014. Such achievement has led Lamarr to be dubbed “the mother of Wi-Fi” and other wireless communications like GPS and Bluetooth.

      <h3 class="banner-title-subtitle">Annie Easley (1933 – 2011)</h3>
      <p class="text-left-justify">Annie Easley was a computer scientist, mathematician, and rocket scientist. She worked on Centaur technology at NASA — a high-energy rocket technology that uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to boost rockets into space. She also co-authored numerous papers about nuclear engines in rockets and she worked on solar, wind, and energy projects. Though she stayed for over 30 years at NASA, having “more good memories than bad,” she was clear-eyed about the racial discrimination she experienced. She was denied financial aid that NASA gave to other employees to pay for additional college courses. No reason was given. “Still, that is not enough to deter me from my life goals,” she later said. “You keep going, because there are people who have authority, and I think sometimes they abuse it. But it makes them think, ‘I’m in charge if I say no.’” Although Easley never had a movie made of her life, she was a hidden figure in her own right as a barrier-breaking mathematician and rocket scientist.

    <h3 class="banner-title-subtitle">Mary Wilkes (b. 1937)</h3>
    <p class="text-left-justify">Mary Wilkes is a former computer programmer and logic designer. She is best known for designing the software for the LINC, one of the earliest systems of an interactive personal computer. Her use of the LINC at home in 1965 made her the first-ever home computer user, and her work has been recognized at The National Museum of Computing, Bletchley Park. Wilkes left the computer field in 1972 to attend Harvard Law School. She practiced as a trial lawyer for many years, both in private practice and as head of the Economic Crime and Consumer Protection Division of the Middlesex County District Attorney’s Office in Massachusetts.
